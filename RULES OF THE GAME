Basic Rules

The person to the left of the dealer starts play.

Next player must match a card to the card on the top of the discard pile, either by number, color or symbol (symbols represent Action Cards).

If you don't have a card that matches the one on the top of the discard pile, you must take a card from the draw pile.

If the card you picked up can be played, you are free to put it down in the same turn. Otherwise, play moves on to the next person in turn.

If you suspect that a Wild Draw 4 card has been played on you illegally (i.e. the player has a card of the matching color), then you may challenge that player.

If guilty, the challenged player must draw 4 cards instead of you.

However, if the challenged player is innocent, you must draw the 4 cards plus an additional 2 cards (6 total)!

If the challenged player has other Wild cards in hand, the challenge still fails.

When you play your next-to-last card, you must tap "UNO" (meaning "one") to indicate that you have only one card left.

If you donâ€™t tap "UNO" and you are caught before the next player begins a turn, you must draw two cards.

Room Mode: Here you can customize your room and invite Facebook friends to join Single or 2v2 matches.

Stack: +2 and +4 cards can be stacked. +2 can only be stacked on +2. Can only play a +2 on a +2 if holding a +2 and +4.

A player that can't add to the stack must draw the total.

Swap on 0: When anyone plays a 0, everyone rotates hands in the direction of play.

Swap on 7: When someone plays a 7, that player must swap hands with another player.

Force: If you draw a playable card, it will be played automatically.
